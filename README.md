## HowTO use BasicSR

`BasicSR` can be used in two ways:
- :arrow_right: Git clone the entire BasicSR. In this way, you can see the complete codes of BasicSR, and then modify them according to your own needs.
- :arrow_right: Use basicsr as a [python package](https://pypi.org/project/basicsr/#history) (that is, install with pip). It provides the training framework, procedures, and some basic functions. You can easily build your own projects based on basicsr.
    ```bash
    pip install basicsr
    ```

Our example mainly focuses on the second one, that is, how to easily and concisely build your own project based on the basicsr package.

There are two ways to use the python package of basicsr, which are provided in two branches:

- :arrow_right: [simple mode](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR-examples/tree/master): the project can be run **without installation**. But it has limitations: it is inconvenient to import complex hierarchical relationships; It is not easy to access the functions in this project from other locations

- :arrow_right: [installation mode](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR-examples/tree/installation): you need to install the project by running `python setup.py develop`. After installation, it is more convenient to import and use.

This `installation` branch uses the *installation mode* for illustration. We recommend using this mode for practical use.

```bash
git clone -b installation https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR-examples.git
cd BasicSR-examples
python setup.py develop  # need to install
```

**Note that**: the installation model requires a package name for installation. We use `basicsrexamples` as the package name.

### Preliminary

Most deep-learning projects can be divided into the following parts:

1. **data**: defines the training/validation data that is fed into the model training
2. **arch** (architecture): defines the network structure and the forward steps
3. **model**: defines the necessary components in training (such as loss) and a complete training process (including forward propagation, back-propagation, gradient optimization, *etc*.), as well as other functions, such as validation, *etc*
4. Training pipeline: defines the training process, that is, connect the data-loader, model, validation, saving checkpoints, *etc*

When we are developing a new method, we often improve the **data**, **arch**, and **model**. Most training processes and basic functions are actually shared. Then, we hope to focus on the development of main functions instead of building wheels repeatedly.

Therefore, we have BasicSR, which separates many shared functions. With BasicSR, we just need to care about the development of **data**, **arch**, and **model**.

In order to further facilitate the use of BasicSR, we provide the basicsr package. You can easily install it through `pip install basicsr`. After that, you can use the training process of BasicSR and the functions already developed in BasicSR~

### A Simple Example

Let's use a simple example to illustrate how to use BasicSR to build your own project.

We provide two sample data for demonstration:
1. [BSDS100](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR-examples/releases/download/0.0.0/BSDS100.zip) for training
1. [Set5](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR-examples/releases/download/0.0.0/Set5.zip) for validation

You can easily download them by running the following command in the BasicSR-examples root path:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_example_data.py
```

The sample data are now in the `datasets/example` folder.

#### :zero: Purpose

Let's use a Super-Resolution task for the demo.
It takes a low-resolution image as the input and outputs a high-resolution image.
The low-resolution images contain: 1) CV2 bicubic X4 downsampling, and 2) JPEG compression (quality = 70).

In order to better explain how to use the arch and model, we use 1) a network structure similar to SRCNN; 2) use L1 and L2 (MSE) loss simultaneously in training.

So, in this task, what we should do are:

1. Build our own data loader
1. Determine the architecture
1. Build our own model

Let's explain it separately in the following parts.

#### :one: data

We need to implement a new dataset to fulfill our purpose. The dataset is used to feed the data into the model.

An example of this dataset is in [basicsrexamples/data/example_dataset.py](basicsrexamples/data/example_dataset.py). It has the following steps.

1. Read Ground-Truth (GT) images. BasicSR provides [FileClient](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/basicsr/utils/file_client.py) for easily reading files in a folder, LMDB file and meta_info txt. In this example, we use the folder mode. For more reading modes, please refer to [basicsr/data](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/tree/master/basicsr/data)
1. Synthesize low resolution images. We can directly implement the data procedures in the `__getitem__(self, index)` function, such as downsampling and adding JPEG compression. Many basic operations can be found in [[basicsr/data/degradations]](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/basicsr/data/degradations.py), [[basicsr/data/tranforms]](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/basicsr/data/transforms.py) ,and [[basicsr/data/data_util]](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/basicsr/data/data_util.py)
1. Convert to torch tensor and return appropriate information

**Note**:

1. Please add `@DATASET_REGISTRY.register()` before `ExampleDataset`. This operation is mainly used to prevent the occurrence of a dataset with the same name, which will result in potential bugs
1. The new dataset file should end with `_dataset.py`, such as `example_dataset.py`. In this way, the program can **automatically** import classes without manual import

In the [option configuration file](options/example_option.yml), you can use the new dataset:

```yaml
datasets:
  train:  # training dataset
    name: ExampleBSDS100
    type: ExampleDataset  # the class name

    # ----- the followings are the arguments of ExampleDataset ----- #
    dataroot_gt: datasets/example/BSDS100
    io_backend:
      type: disk

    gt_size: 128
    use_flip: true
    use_rot: true

    # ----- arguments of data loader ----- #
    use_shuffle: true
    num_worker_per_gpu: 3
    batch_size_per_gpu: 16
    dataset_enlarge_ratio: 10
    prefetch_mode: ~

  val:  # validation dataset
    name: ExampleSet5
    type: ExampleDataset
    dataroot_gt: datasets/example/Set5
    io_backend:
      type: disk
```

#### :two: arch

An example of architecture is in [basicsrexamples/archs/example_arch.py](basicsrexamples/archs/example_arch.py). It mainly builds the network structure.

**Note**:

1. Add `@ARCH_REGISTRY.register()` before `ExampleArch`, so as to register the newly implemented arch. This operation is mainly used to prevent the occurrence of arch with the same name, resulting in potential bugs
1. The new arch file should end with `_arch.py`, such as `example_arch.py`. In this way, the program can **automatically** import classes without manual import

In the [option configuration file](options/example_option.yml), you can use the new arch:

```yaml
# network structures
network_g:
  type: ExampleArch  # the class name

  # ----- the followings are the arguments of ExampleArch ----- #
  num_in_ch: 3
  num_out_ch: 3
  num_feat: 64
  upscale: 4
```

#### :three: model

An example of model is in [basicsrexamples/models/example_model.py](basicsrexamples/models/example_model.py). It mainly builds the training process of a model.

In this file:
1. We inherit `SRModel` from basicsr. Many models have similar operations, so you can inherit and modify from [basicsr/models](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/tree/master/basicsr/models). In this way, you can easily implement your ideas, such as GAN model, video model, *etc*.
1. Two losses are used: L1 and L2 (MSE) loss
1. Many other contents, such as `setup_optimizers`, `validation`, `save`, *etc*, are inherited from `SRModel`

**Note**:

1. Add `@MODEL_REGISTRY.register()` before `ExampleModel`, so as to register the newly implemented model. This operation is mainly used to prevent the occurrence of model with the same name, resulting in potential bugs
1. The new model file should end with `_model.py`, such as `example_model.py`. In this way, the program can **automatically** import classes without manual import

In the [option configuration file](options/example_option.yml), you can use the new model:

```yaml
# training settings
train:
  optim_g:
    type: Adam
    lr: !!float 2e-4
    weight_decay: 0
    betas: [0.9, 0.99]

  scheduler:
    type: MultiStepLR
    milestones: [50000]
    gamma: 0.5

  total_iter: 100000
  warmup_iter: -1  # no warm up

  # ----- the followings are the configurations for two losses ----- #
  # losses
  l1_opt:
    type: L1Loss
    loss_weight: 1.0
    reduction: mean

  l2_opt:
    type: MSELoss
    loss_weight: 1.0
    reduction: mean
```

#### :four: training pipeline

The whole training pipeline can reuse the [basicsr/train.py](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/basicsr/train.py) in BasicSR.

Based on this, our [basicsrexamples/train.py](basicsrexamples/train.py) can be very concise:

```python
import os.path as osp

import archs  # noqa: F401
import data  # noqa: F401
import models  # noqa: F401
from basicsr.train import train_pipeline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root_path = osp.abspath(osp.join(__file__, osp.pardir))
    train_pipeline(root_path)

```

#### :five: debug mode

So far, we have completed the development of our project. We can quickly check whether there is a bug through the `debug` mode:

```bash
python basicsrexamples/train.py -opt options/example_option.yml --debug
```

With `--debug`, the program will enter the debug mode. In the debug mode, the program will output at each iteration, and perform validation every 8 iterations, so that you can easily know whether the program has a bug~

#### :six: normal training

After debugging, we can have the normal training.

```bash
python basicsrexamples/train.py -opt options/example_option.yml
```

If the training process is interrupted unexpectedly and the resume is required. Please use `--auto_resume` in the command:

```bash
python train.py -opt options/example_option.yml --auto_resume
```

So far, you have finished developing your own projects using `BasicSR`. Isn't it very convenient~ :grin:

## As a Template

You can use BasicSR-Examples as a template for your project. Here are some modifications you may need.

As GitHub does not support a specific branch as a template, we need extra steps to use the `installation` branch as the template.

1. Click `Use this template` and remember to check the `[ ] Include all branches` checkbox
2. Change the installation branch to the master branch
    ```bash
    git clone -b installation YOUR_REPO  # clone the installation branch
    cd REPO_NAME
    git branch -m installation master  # rename the installation branch to master
    git push -f origin master  # force push the local master branch to remote
    git push origin --delete installation  # delete the remote installation branch
    ```

You may need to modify the following files:

1. Set up the *pre-commit* hook
    1. In the root path, run:
    > pre-commit install
1. Modify the `LICENSE`<br>
    This repository uses the *MIT* license, you may change it to other licenses

As the installation mode requires the package name, you also need to modify all the `basicsrexamples` names to YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME.
Here are the detailed locations that contain the `basicsrexamples` name:
1. The `basicsrexamples` folder
1. [setup.py](setup.py#L9); &emsp; [setup.py](setup.py#L48); &emsp;[setup.py](setup.py#L91)
1. [basicsrexamples/train.py](basicsrexamples/train.py#L4-L6)
1. [basicsrexamples/archs/\_\_init\_\_.py](basicsrexamples/archs/__init__.py#L11)
1. [basicsrexamples/data/\_\_init\_\_.py](basicsrexamples/data/__init__.py#L11)
1. [basicsrexamples/models/\_\_init\_\_.py](basicsrexamples/models/__init__.py#L11)

You also need to modify the corresponding information in the [setup.py](setup.py#L88-L113).
